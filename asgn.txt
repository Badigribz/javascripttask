WHAT ARE VARIABLES

    Variables are Containers for Storing Data
    JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

    -Automatically
    -Using var
    -Using let
    -Using const


Automaticaly declaring:
    x = 5;
    y = 6;
    z = x + y;


Using var

    var a = 5;
    var b = 6;
    var c = a + b;

Using let

    let d = c + z;

using const

    const e = d - 12;


When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.




let Can be reassigned,var Can be reassigned and updated,const Cannot be reassigned. It is a constant and cannot have its value changed once assigned.



























WHAT ARE ARROW FUNCTIONS

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:





















WHAT ARE TEMPLATE lierals

String Templates,Template Strings,Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string

























COMMENTS

methods to write piece of information that do not involve the code itself
may be a way to explain chunks of code 































String concatenation using the + operator and string interpolation using template literals (${}) are two ways to combine strings in JavaScript.



























WHAT IS HOISTING
It is declaration of a variable 
then assigning it later
or the other way around
